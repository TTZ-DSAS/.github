## Repository for all TTZ-DSAS repositories

### Repo name definition

Structure the repos in the following order:

&lt;project&gt; _ &lt;subProject&gt; _ &lt;type&gt; _ &lt;useCase&gt; _ &lt;type&gt; _ &lt;optional&gt;

Explanation:

- project: The primary name of the project (e.g., swisslog).
- subProject: The secondary name, what the repo is about (e.g., tinderApp).
- type: The type of the repository (e.g., backend, frontend).
- useCase: The specific use-case (e.g., analytics, API, service, database, k8sService).
- optional: Any additional information (e.g. experimental, v2, customerSpecific).

Example:

swisslog_tinderApp_backend_k8sService

It is advisable to commence with a lowercase letter, subsequently employing camel case if necessary, and separating the constituent elements with an underscore.
